  "/home/rathore/devel/langchain-agent/test-wiki/images/architecture.png": " This is an architecture diagram of a web application system. It shows a high-level view of the components and their relationships within the system. At the top, there is a label \"Web Tier\" with two sub-components: \"CDN\" (Content Delivery Network) and \"User Service.\" Below these, there are three main components connected by arrows indicating data flow or interaction:\n\n1. \"PostgreSQL Database\" - This is likely the database component of the system, where data is stored and managed.\n2. \"Redis Cache\" - A caching layer that stores frequently accessed data temporarily to improve performance.\n3. \"Akka Platform Architecture\" - This could be a framework or platform for building distributed systems, possibly indicating the underlying technology stack used in this architecture.\n\nThe diagram also includes a label \"Order Service,\" which is connected to both the CDN and the User Service, suggesting that it interacts with both of these components. The arrows between the components indicate the direction of data flow or interaction within the system.\n\nAt the bottom of the diagram, there are two additional labels: \"Redis Search\" and \"Kafka,\" which might represent other services or technologies used in this architecture. These labels suggest that the system uses Redis for search functionality and Kafka for message queuing and processing.\n\nThe overall purpose of this diagram is to illustrate how different components within a web application system interact with each other, providing a visual representation of the system's architecture. It helps in understanding the flow of data and the structure of the system. "
